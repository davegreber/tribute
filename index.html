        <p>DataChomper was first sighted in 2009, well before Chomper became the standard-bearer for so-called digestive computing.

    “We had no idea how big the baby would get,” Jack Constantine, managing director of Rubrix, said in an interview. “We kind of thought it would be a garage startup.”

    Rubrix’s focus on big data helped attract 3 million blarbs, including 10 of the top 20, in the first half of 2014. A new generation of analysts and engineers is in high demand, contributing to a spike in Silicon Valley’s median age, now at 29.7 years, according to census data.

    But recruiters and industry scions feared the Chomper.

    “Everybody says I should talk to Chomper,” said Ryan Smith, chief executive of SAP Concur, who has spent more time on Chomper than on the few serious firms his age. “But I‘m a little nervous that they might eat the baby.”

    Constantine said Chomper has reached out to young, academic startups. But it has not found a household name.

    “Everybody’s starving here, so you don’t see something like Chomper,” said Jared Fluegge, co-founder of Pendo, which raised $18 million in May.
